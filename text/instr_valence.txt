The VALENCE scale measures how positive or negative you are feeling.
 
At the far left you would be feeling very negative, that could be unhappy, upset, irritated, frustrated, angry, sad, depressed, or some other negative feeling.
 
At the far right you would be feeling very positive: That could be happy, pleased, satisfied, competent, proud, content, delighted, or some other positive feeling.
 
In the middle of this scale you would be feeling completely neutral, neither positive or negative.  From the neutral midpoint, the ratings get gradually more negative as you move left, and gradually more positive as you move right.

Use your FIRST finger to move the indicator on the scale towards negative and your MIDDLE finger to move the indicator towards positive. Press the THIRD button to select your rating and advance to the next trial.
