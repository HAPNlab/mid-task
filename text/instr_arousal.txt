The AROUSAL scale measures how aroused you are feeling at a given time.
 
At the far right on this scale, you would be feeling very alert, aroused, activated, charged or energized, very physically or mentally aroused.
 
At the far left, you would be feeling completely unaroused, slow, still, de-energized, no physical or mental arousal at all.
 
Notice that this AROUSAL scale is a continuum going from low to high arousal.  The point in the middle of the scale would represent being moderately aroused; a point in between the two extremes.  It does not mean neutral.
 
Use your MIDDLE finger to move the indicator on the scale towards higher arousal. Press the THIRD button to select your rating and advance to the next trial.
