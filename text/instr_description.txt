Think about the scales as capturing separate aspects of your how you are feeling.
 
So, the arousal scale doesn't tell us whether you are feeling good or bad; it is capturing more this idea of physical or mental activation.  So, for example you could be feeling very aroused and positive (suppose you were really excited because you had just won a prize) or very aroused and negative (suppose you were really angry because someone had just stolen your parking space). 

On the other hand, you could be feeling really unaroused and positive (if you were relaxing and looking at a beautiful sunset) or really unaroused and negative (if you were feeling down and depressed).
 
We want you to report the negative or positive dimension of your feeling on the one scale, and the arousal aspect on the other.
