In this task, you will be able to win money if you are quick enough. Your task is to press a button when you see the white triangle. 
On trials where the white triangle is preceded by a circle, you will win the amount shown if you press the key while the white triangle is on the screen. 
On trials where the white triangle is preceded by a diamond, you will avoid losing the amount shown if you press the key while the white triangle is on the screen. 
On trials where the white triangle is preceded by a hexagon, you will neither win nor lose anything, but we still want you to press any key while the white triangle is on the screen.
Each trial will be either low (20%), medium (50%), or high (80%) accuracy level. The white triangle will be shown for a shorter duration in low accuracy trials and a longer duration in high accuracy trials.  
Finally, after each trial, you will see the monetary reward earned on the last trial. We will add whatever you win in this task to the amount that we pay you today. No practice trials will be presented for this task, and it will include two sessions, each lasting several minutes. If you have questions or are unsure about what your task is, please ask the experimenter now.
