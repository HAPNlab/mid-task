You will now see a selection of the cues from the task you just performed. Each cue will be accompanied by a rating scale. The title above each scale indicates which rating you are being asked to make.  Please pay attention as to which of the following 2 ratings you will be asked to make:\nThe VALENCE scale\nThe AROUSAL scale
The VALENCE scale measures how positive or negative you are feeling. At the far left you would be feeling very negative, that could be unhappy, upset, irritated, frustrated, angry, sad, depressed, or some other negative feeling. At the far right you would be feeling very positive: That could be happy, pleased, satisfied, competent, proud, content, delighted, or some other positive feeling. In the middle of this scale you would be feeling completely neutral, neither positive or negative.  From the neutral midpoint, the ratings get gradually more negative as you move left, and gradually more positive as you move right.\nUse your FIRST finger to move the indicator on the scale towards negative and your MIDDLE finger to move the indicator towards positive. Press the THIRD button to select your rating and advance to the next trial.
***VALENCE SCALE***
The AROUSAL scale measures how aroused you are feeling at a given time. At the far right on this scale, you would be feeling very alert, aroused, activated, charged or energized, very physically or mentally aroused. At the far left, you would be feeling completely unaroused, slow, still, de-energized, no physical or mental arousal at all. Notice that this AROUSAL scale is a continuum going from low to high arousal.  The point in the middle of the scale would represent being moderately aroused; a point in between the two extremes.  It does not mean neutral. Use your MIDDLE finger to move the indicator on the scale towards higher arousal.
***AROUSAL SCALE***
Think about the scales as capturing separate aspects of your how you are feeling. So, the arousal scale doesn't tell us whether you are feeling good or bad; it’s capturing more this idea of physical or mental activation.  So, for example you could be feeling very aroused and positive (suppose you were really excited because you had just won a prize) or very aroused and negative (suppose you were really angry because someone had just stolen your parking space). On the other hand, you could be feeling really unaroused and positive (if you were relaxing and looking at a beautiful sunset) or really unaroused and negative (if you were feeling down and depressed). We want you to report the negative or positive dimension of your feeling on the one scale, and the arousal aspect on the other.
Please make ratings individually for each particular cue. Please make your ratings as accurately as possible.
